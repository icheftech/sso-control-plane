# Southern Shade S.S.O. Platform - Complete Onboarding Guide

## AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST

This is a **REAL-WORLD ENTERPRISE SYSTEM**, not coursework or a demo. You are building production-grade software for regulated industries (government, healthcare) that will handle PHI/PII data. Every component must be:

- **Production-ready**: Can handle heavy workloads
- **Compliant**: NIST AI RMF, HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC 2 aligned
- **Secure**: Cryptographic audit trails, zero-trust architecture
- **Professional**: Enterprise-grade code quality and documentation

**Timeline**: This system must be ready to offer to clients within 2-3 weeks.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is S.S.O.?

**Southern Shade Orchestrator (S.S.O.)** is a patent-pending platform that enables AI agents to operate across any cloud infrastructure while maintaining cryptographically verifiable audit trails and human control. It delivers "governed autonomy" for regulated industries.

**Simple explanation (for non-technical stakeholders):**
S.S.O. is a control system that lets AI helpers do work across different computer systems (like Amazon, Microsoft, Google clouds) while keeping humans in charge of important decisions and creating permanent records of everything that happens - like a security camera and supervisor combined into one.

### Business Model

S.S.O. is a **platform and service offering**, NOT a resale product. Revenue streams:

1. **Professional Services** - Custom implementation and integration
2. **Managed Services** - 24/7 monitoring, maintenance, optimization
3. **Platform Deployments** - Turnkey installations (cloud/hybrid/on-premises)
4. **Architecture & Governance** - Strategic oversight and compliance consulting

### Company Information

**Southern Shade LLC**
- **SAM.gov Registered Entity** (All procurement under southernshade.co)
- **Location**: Texas, United States
- **Contact**: contact@southernshade.com
- **Domains**: 
  - southernshade.co (SAM.gov registration)
  - southernshadellc.com (to be acquired and linked)

**Past Client Work** (Safe to reference):
- Powell Industries - Kanban system implementation (2009)
- Chicago Bridge and Iron

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS (LOCKED)

### 1. First Workflow to Ship
**DECISION**: Production change management with human-in-the-loop approval

**Why**: This showcases S.S.O.'s core value proposition:
- Governed autonomy
- Human approval gates
- Full cryptographic audit trails
- Cross-cloud agent orchestration

**What it does**: An AI agent proposes a change (update record, approve transaction, deploy code), S.S.O. enforces human approval + cryptographic audit before committing.

### 2. Cloud Platform for Pilot
**DECISION**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

**Why**:
- Mature agent backends (Bedrock, ECS/EKS, Lambda)
- Strong multi-account, private networking patterns
- HIPAA-eligible services
- Future GovCloud support
- Easy S.S.O. central control plane hosting (EKS)

### 3. Authentication
**DECISION**: Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) as primary

**Why**:
- Enterprise buyers in regulated industries standardize on Microsoft
- Provides: SSO, conditional access, MFA, group/role-based access
- Fallback email/password can be added later

### 4. Data Sensitivity
**DECISION**: Assume YES - touching PHI/PII in pilot

**Why**:
- Forces proper architecture from day one (encryption, RBAC, logging, data minimization)
- Avoids redesign later
- Can start with de-identified test data operationally, but contracts/controls are PHI/PII-grade

### 5. Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI (REST API)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (data persistence)
- Redis (caching, session management)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Alembic (database migrations)

**Frontend**:
- React with TypeScript
- Next.js framework
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

**Infrastructure**:
- AWS EKS (Kubernetes)
- Docker containers
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

**Blockchain/Audit**:
- SHA-256 hash-chained audit logs (immutable ledger)
- OpenTelemetry for observability (logs, traces, metrics)

---

## NIST AI RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT

S.S.O. implements all four NIST AI RMF functions as a closed loop:

### 1. GOVERN
**What**: Define policies, ownership, and decision authority

**S.S.O. Components**:
- `ControlPolicy` model - governance rules
- `PolicyPack` - signed, versioned policy bundles
- Risk tier definitions (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- System registry - inventory of workflows, agents, tools, connectors

### 2. MAP
**What**: Identify context, capabilities, and risks

**S.S.O. Components**:
- `Workflow` model - AI agent task definitions
- `Capability` model - granular permissions (API calls, DB access, file ops)
- `Connector` model - external system integrations
- Risk level assignment per workflow

### 3. MEASURE
**What**: Test, assess, and track performance

**S.S.O. Components**:
- `AuditEvent` model - cryptographic event log (SHA-256 hash chain)
- `GateExecution` model - performance metrics per policy checkpoint
- OpenTelemetry traces - real-time observability
- Continuous monitoring dashboard

### 4. MANAGE
**What**: Operate, respond to incidents, maintain controls

**S.S.O. Components**:
- `EnforcementGate` model - policy checkpoints
- `KillSwitch` model - emergency stops (GLOBAL, WORKFLOW, CAPABILITY scopes)
- `BreakGlass` model - time-bounded emergency access
- `ChangeRequest` model - production change governance (FLAGSHIP)

## SECURITY & COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### OWASP LLM Top 10 Mitigations

**Excessive Agency** (LLM08):
- ✅ Agents can only PROPOSE actions, never execute directly
- ✅ Workflow engine + policy layer authorizes execution
- ✅ Non-bypassable rule - codify in architecture

**Insecure Plugin Design** (LLM07):
- ✅ Tool sandboxing - every capability call is scoped, authenticated, rate-limited
- ✅ Treat all tool inputs as hostile
- ✅ Least-privilege retrieval

**Sensitive Information Disclosure** (LLM06):
- ✅ Output redaction filters
- ✅ Data-loss guards
- ✅ Field-level encryption for PHI/PII

### Audit Trail Requirements

**Cryptographic Ledger**:
- SHA-256 hash chain (each event includes hash of previous event)
- Immutable append-only log
- Tamper-evident (chain breaks if any event modified)

**OpenTelemetry Integration**:
- Correlation IDs: `workflow_run_id`, `policy_version`, `approval_id`, `capability_id`, `connector_attempt`
- Emit audit event (ledger) AND ops signal (trace/log/metric) for every state transition
- Real-time operator correlation across services

### Operational Resilience

**Kill Switches** (Priority Implementation):
- Per-tenant toggles
- Per-workflow toggles
- Per-capability toggles
- Per-connector toggles
- Required fields: reason, owner, timestamp, scope
- Runtime enforcement: EVERY execution gate checks kill-switch state FIRST

**Break-Glass Access**:
- Strong authentication required
- Time-bounded privileges (auto-expire)
- Mandatory post-incident review
- Generates records in hash-chained registry log

**Continuous Monitoring**:
- Drift detection
- Anomaly detection
- Policy violations
- "Agent misbehavior" triggers → incident workflows

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### PHASE 5: Identity Federation (IN PROGRESS)

#### 5.1 Microsoft Entra ID Integration

**What to build**:

1. **Backend OAuth2 Flow** (`backend/app/auth/entra.py`):
```python
# AGENT NOTE: Implement these endpoints
# - /auth/entra/login - Redirect to Microsoft login
# - /auth/entra/callback - Handle OAuth2 callback
# - /auth/entra/token - Exchange code for tokens
# - /auth/entra/refresh - Refresh access tokens
# - /auth/entra/logout - Clear session
```

2. **User Profile Sync** (`backend/app/auth/sync.py`):
```python
# AGENT NOTE: Sync these fields from Entra ID to local DB
# - email, name, groups, roles
# - Map Entra groups to S.S.O. permissions
# - Handle group membership changes
```

3. **Environment Variables** (`.env`):
```bash
# AGENT NOTE: Add these to .env.example and document
ENTRA_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id  
ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/entra/callback
```

#### 5.2 Fallback Email/Password Auth

**What to build** (`backend/app/auth/local.py`):
- Password hashing (bcrypt)

- Password reset flow
- Session management

**AGENT NOTE**: Entra ID is PRIMARY. Email/password is for:
- Demo environments
- Internal development
- Emergency access scenarios

### PHASE 6: Frontend Dashboard (NEXT PRIORITY)

**Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Next.js + Tailwind CSS

**Key Pages**:

1. **Login Page** (`/login`):
   - "Sign in with Microsoft" button (primary)
   - Email/password form (secondary)
   - Remember me option
   - Password reset link

2. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
   - Workflow status cards
   - Pending approvals (high priority)
   - Recent audit events
   - System health metrics
   - Kill switch status indicators

3. **Workflows** (`/workflows`):
   - List all workflows (filterable by status, risk level)
   - Create new workflow
   - Edit workflow configuration
   - View workflow execution history

4. **Change Requests** (`/change-requests`):
   - Pending approvals list
   - Approve/reject interface
   - Change history
   - Risk assessment display
   - Audit trail viewer

5. **Audit Log** (`/audit`):
   - Searchable event log
   - Filter by: actor, resource, event type, date range
   - Hash chain verification status
   - Export to CSV/JSON

6. **Settings** (`/settings`):
   - User profile
   - Notification preferences
   - API keys management
   - Kill switches (emergency)

**AGENT NOTE**: Use shadcn/ui components for consistency. All pages must be responsive (mobile-first).

### PHASE 7: Flagship Workflow - Production Change Management

**What to build** (`backend/app/workflows/change_management.py`):

```python
# AGENT NOTE: This is the FLAGSHIP workflow that showcases S.S.O. value

class ChangeManagementWorkflow:
    """
    High-risk production change with multi-stage approval.
    
    Flow:
    1. Agent proposes change (e.g., update database record)
    2. S.S.O. creates ChangeRequest
    3. Risk assessment (auto-calculated)
    4. Route to approver(s) based on risk level:
       - LOW: Auto-approve if policy allows
       - MEDIUM: Single approver
       - HIGH: Two approvers
       - CRITICAL: Three approvers + compliance officer
    5. Upon approval, execute change
    6. Log to cryptographic audit trail
    7. Notify stakeholders
    
    Security:
    - Every step generates audit event
    - Kill switch checked at EVERY gate
    - Break-glass path available (with mandatory review)
    - Full rollback capability
    """
```

**Database Flow**:
```
Agent → ChangeRequest (PENDING)
     → EnforcementGate (PRE_APPROVAL)
     → Approvals (based on risk level)
     → EnforcementGate (PRE_EXECUTION)
     → Execute change
     → EnforcementGate (POST_EXECUTION)
     → ChangeRequest (APPROVED/COMPLETED)
     → AuditEvent (hash-chained)
```
