Phase 1: Registry Backbone (MAP)
- Workflow: AI agent workflows/tasks
- Capability: Granular permissions for agents
- Connector: External system integrations

Phase 2: Controls (MANAGE)
- ControlPolicy: Governance policies
- KillSwitch: Emergency stop mechanisms
- BreakGlass: Emergency access procedures

Phase 3: Enforcement Integration
- AuditEvent: Immutable audit log with hash chaining
- EnforcementGate: Policy evaluation checkpoints
- GateExecution: Gate execution history
- ChangeRequest: Governed production change workflow (FLAGSHIP)

Usage:
    from app.db.models import Workflow, Capability, ControlPolicy
    from app.db.models import KillSwitch, BreakGlass, ChangeRequest
    from app.db.models import AuditEvent, EnforcementGate
